Crystal healing as an alternative to medicine

Testable/Falsifiable
Continually tested
Simple 
Elegant




What type of observations should we seek to confirm the effiacy of crystal healing power?

To determine the efficacy of Crystal Healing power, observations would need to be made of its effect. A scientific theory should be (1) testable/falsifiable, (2) continually tested, (3) simple, and (4) elegant.

To test a theory about the efficacy of Crystal Healing, observations would need to be made of its power. This would require an observation of crystal healing effectively treating a medical illness where no other medical alternatives are applied. Further, to confirm Crystal Healing as the source of the healing power, an individual in the same circumstances without crystal healing and without alternative medication would need to continually show symptoms (no evidence of healing, where healing did take place under the application of Crystal Healing).

Isolated experiments could be conducted on the effect of the Crystal Healing methodology applied to the medical illnesses in question (assuming they can be isolated, such as viruses, etc) when compared to the regular activity of the medical illness.


Why does crystal healing make for a poor theory of medicine?

As mentioned above, a scientific throey, for medicine or otherwise, should be (1) testable/falsifiable, (2) continually tested, (3) simple, and (4) elegant. Crystal Healing is generally regarded as a passive process that can take a great deal of time. During this time, the environment being tested can change significantly
